excerpt: Improving forecast accuracy, extending lead time, understanding hazard susceptibility, and integrating exposure and vulnerability data to generate impact-based forecasts are critical in mitigating disaster impacts. These efforts enable anticipatory action through enhancing the efficacy of early warning systems to assess potential multi-dimensional hazard impacts. In response to this need, SERVIR has co-developed a series of hazard services providing vital information from national to regional scales. This poster showcases examples of geospatial services co-developed with partners through a capacity building approach, supporting the establishment of hazard early warning / early action systems. These services integrate multidimensional vulnerability and exposure data to comprehensively assess impacts. Furthermore, these services demonstrate how co-development and capacity building can advance the development of impact-based forecasts and multi-hazards services. By prioritizing collaboration, human insights, local knowledge, capacity building, and employing applied science approaches in geospatial service development, this work has helped create inclusive and customized solutions. These solutions are tailored to meet the needs of local communities and are readily adaptable into decision-making processes.
