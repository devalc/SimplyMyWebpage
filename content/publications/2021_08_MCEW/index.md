# Abstract

An increased emphasis on fuel management strategies to mitigate wildfire risks is raising the awareness and need for comprehensive forest management strategies that satisfy long-term water quantity and water quality needs. Forest management activities can alter the soil nutrient pools and affect the timing and magnitude of stream water quantity and quality. We investigated the effect of contemporary forest management activities, including clear-cutting and thinning, on water yield and stream nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in a quarter-century long (1992-2016) paired and nested watershed study in the interior Pacific Northwest, US. Monthly water samples were collected and analyzed for total Kjeldhal nitrogen (TKN), total available nitrogen (TAN), nitrate + nitrite (NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub>), total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate (OP) concentrations throughout the study period. Five years of pre-disturbance data, 4 years of post-road construction, 6 years of Phase I (PH-I) experimental post-harvest, and 9 years of Phase II (PH-II) operational harvest data were analyzed using a before-after, control-impact paired series (BACIPS) study design. We found statistically significant increases in stream NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> loading from the paired and nested watersheds following timber harvest treatments. In the case of OP, any increase in nutrient load was attributed to increases in streamflow, as OP concentrations remained near minimum detectable concentrations. Streamflow increased the greatest following clear-cut practices (33.4% at W1 during PH-I) with the largest response in stream NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> concentration (up to 0.33 mg-N L<sup>-1</sup> at W1). Instream NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> and OP concentrations were lower in the downstream cumulative watersheds, which was likely due to dilution and nutrient assimilation effects. Interestingly, the NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, streamflow, and loads of NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> and OP from the undisturbed control watershed also increased. This increase was, however, smaller than the harvested watersheds and likely driven by climate variability or subtle forest succession changes. In summary, we found that contemporary forest management activities increased stream NO<sub>3</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and loads following timber harvest activities, but these effects were also attenuated due to downstream uptake processes. Furthermore, relative to post-wildfire impacts, these nutrient increases are small and short-lived.
