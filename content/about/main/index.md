  <font size="5.5"><span style="color:#FF3C38">In a nutshell</span></font><br><br>
  My expertise lies in retrieving, processing, and analyzing large datasets to derive valuable insights. I specialize in working with complex geospatial and environmental data and hydrologic models, particularly in the context of addressing climate risks and building resilience.

  I am employed as a geospatial data analyst at FM Global. In this role, I focus on natural hazards and utilize my skills in geospatial data engineering and ETL tasks to provide comprehensive and practical solutions to business challenges. By leveraging advanced techniques, I contribute to creating a safer and more resilient environment. I also serve as a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/), where I developed cutting-edge automated reporting products and decision support tools for post-wildfire risk management.

  I received my PhD in Water Resources from the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). As a part of [Dr. Erin Brooks'](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/soil-and-water-systems/our-people/erin-brooks) research group, my work focused on improving the understanding of the implications of various land management strategies on water quality. By employing advanced hydrology and water resources models, along with extensive geospatial datasets, I developed data-driven tools to support environmental management-related decision-making and address climate risks.

  <font size="5.5"><span style="color:#FF3C38">Previously</span></font><br><br>
  I had the privilege of being a [Utrecht Excellence Scholar](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/general-information/international-students/financial-matters/grants-and-scholarships/utrecht-excellence-scholarships) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) in the Netherlands. During this time, I worked extensively with the PCR-GLOBWB model, a state-of-the-art global hydrology and water resources model. By integrating remote sensing products and applying innovative approaches, I derived critical water management insights in regions facing severe water scarcity.
