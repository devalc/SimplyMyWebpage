  I retrieve and process large datasets and leverage my modeling and analytical skills to generate insights from complex environmental datasets to inform sustainable strategies for addressing climate risks.

  I'm a PhD candidate with the [Department of Soil and Water Systems](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/soil-and-water-systems/) at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). As a part of [Dr. Erin Brooks'](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/soil-and-water-systems/our-people/erin-brooks) research group my research focuses on improving the understanding of the implications of various land management strategies on water quality by employing hydrology and water resources models along with large datasets. Here, I also build data-driven tools to inform strategies targeted at addressing climate risks and supporting environmental management-related decision-making.

  I was a [Utrecht Excellence Scholar](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/general-information/international-students/financial-matters/grants-and-scholarships/utrecht-excellence-scholarships) at the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) in the Netherlands. There I employed the next generation global hydrology and water resources model (PCR-GLOBWB) along with various remote sensing products to derive water management insights in some of the most water stressed regions of the world.
