  <font size="5.5"><span style="color:#FF3C38">In a nutshell</span></font><br><br>
  I retrieve and process large datasets and leverage my modeling and analytical skills to generate insights from complex geospatial and environmental datasets to inform strategies for addressing climate risks.

  I am a geospatial data analyst at FM Global, where I focus on natural hazards related geospatial data engineering and ETL tasks to provide comprehensive and practical solutions to business challenges. As a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/) I develop automated reporting products and decision support tools for informing post-wildfire risks and management decisions.

  I received my PhD in Water Resources from the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). As a part of [Dr. Erin Brooks'](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/soil-and-water-systems/our-people/erin-brooks) research group my work focused on improving the understanding of the implications of various land management strategies on water quality by employing hydrology and water resources models along with large geospatial datasets. Here, I also built data-driven tools to inform strategies targeted at addressing climate risks and supporting environmental management-related decision-making.

  <font size="5.5"><span style="color:#FF3C38">Previously</span></font><br><br>
  I was a [Utrecht Excellence Scholar](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/general-information/international-students/financial-matters/grants-and-scholarships/utrecht-excellence-scholarships) at the [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) in the Netherlands. There I employed the next generation global hydrology and water resources model (PCR-GLOBWB) along with various remote sensing products to derive water management insights in some of the most water stressed regions of the world.
