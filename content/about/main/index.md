   I lead the Water Security Thematic area at the [SERVIR](https://servirglobal.net/) Science Coordination Office. SERVIR is a joint NASA and USAID partnership that harnesses the power of satellite data and science collaboration to support locally led efforts to strengthen climate resilience. Within the [Water Security Thematic Area](https://servirglobal.net/what-we-do/water-security), we utilize Earth observation-driven services and capacity-building initiatives to help partners enhance sustainable access to freshwater and promote cooperation over shared water resources. I am particularly passionate about translating science into actionable insights to support environmental decision-making.
   
   I hold a PhD in Water Resources Engineering from the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). As a part of [Dr. Erin Brooks']() research group, my work focused on improving the understanding of the implications of various land management strategies on water quality. By employing advanced hydrology and water resources models, along with extensive geospatial datasets, I developed data-driven tools to inform stakeholdersâ€™ strategies in addressing climate risks and guiding environmental decision-making.
   
   Previously, I had the privilege of being a [Utrecht Excellence Scholar](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/general-information/application-and-admission/scholarships-and-grants/utrecht-excellence-scholarships) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/) in the Netherlands. During this time, I worked extensively with the PCR-GLOBWB model, a state-of-the-art global hydrology and water resources model. By integrating earth observation data and applying innovative approaches, my work focused on deriving critical water management insights in regions facing severe water scarcity.
