***
A Shiny web application that provides an interactive visualization
of statistical comparisons between SNOTEL observed Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and WEPP model simulated SWE using multiple precipitation/temperature products. This allows WEPP users to zoom in on to their watershed area and select the climate product that results in relatively better model predictions for their watershed area.
